    <h1>Ways to Prevent Aquatic Life from Extinction</h1>
    <p>Aquatic life is an important part of our environment, but many species are facing extinction due to human activities.
       To protect them, we must understand the causes of the problem and take effective action. 
       There are several ways to prevent aquatic life from disappearing, and each method involves knowing why it is important and how we can do it.</p>
    <section id="Reduce Water Pollution">
      <h2>Reduce Water Pollution</h2>
      <p>Polluted water harms marine animals and destroys their habitats, making it difficult for them to survive.</p>
      <p>How? We can stop this by treating industrial waste properly, avoiding the use of harmful chemicals at home, and making sure rubbish is thrown away correctly instead of into rivers or drains.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Stop Overfishing">
      <h2>Stop Overfishing</h2>
      <p> Humans catch too many fish, the population cannot recover, and many species become endangered.</p>
      <p>How? Governments can set fishing limits, fishermen needs to follow sustainable practices, and consumers can choose seafood that comes from responsible sources.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Protect Marine Habitats">
      <h2>Protect Marine Habitats</h2>      
      <p>Habitats like coral reefs and mangroves are home to thousands of marine species, and destroying them threatens the entire ecosystem.</p>
      <p>How? We can protect these areas by creating marine protected zones, avoiding damaging activities like stepping on corals, and reducing coastal development.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="ReducePlasticUse">
      <h2>Reduce Plastic Use</h2>
      <p>Plastic pollution is one of the biggest threats to aquatic life, as animals often eat it or get trapped in it, which can cause injury or death. </p>
      <p>How? People can use reusable bags, bottles, and containers, while communities can organise clean-up projects to remove plastic from beaches and rivers.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Support Marine Conservation Efforts">
      <h2>Support Marine Conservation Efforts</h2>
      <p>Conservation organisations work to protect endangered species, restore damaged habitats, and educate the public.</p>
      <p>How? We can help by donating, volunteering, participating in awareness campaigns, or sharing information to encourage others to care for marine life.</p>
